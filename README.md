## By Ramin Dürst & Matthias Schönholzer (base code provided by Claudia Bank)

### List of content of repository:
### Report_FloodingEvoRescue_Model_ScM_DüR_First draft.pdf
This is the first draft of the report (due 08.11.2024).

### Report_FloodingEvoRescue_Model_ScM_DüR_Final draft.pdf / .docx
These are the final drafts of the report as a word- and pdf-file (due 06.12.2024). 

### Flooding_rescue_THEE-project.Rmd
This is the main code containing the model, created with RStudio, and is expanded on the base code by Claudia Bank.

### THEE-project-Appendix.Rmd
Contains chuncks of code, that were not used in the finished code or were used to try things out. Nothing really important, is mainly there for hoarding.

### evolutionary-rescue-basic-discrete-time.Rmd
Base Code provided by Claudia Bank. Simulates a simple evolutionary rescue.

### Impact of frequency of floodings on plant populations_PPP.pptx
The powerpoint presentation of our project presentation.

### Papers (Folder)
Contains several different papers that were or will be used for research for the final report.

### images (Folder)
Contains several images of plots that were generated for the model, as well as sketches and notes from the beginning of the project phase.
