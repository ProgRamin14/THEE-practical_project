### Flooding_rescue_THEE-project.Rmd
This is the main code containing the model, created with RStudio, is expanding on base code by Claudia Bank.

### Impact of frequency of floodings on plant populations_PPP.pptx
The powerpoint presentation of our project presentation.

### THEE-project-Appendix.Rmd
Contains chuncks of code, that were not used in the finished code or weder use to try things out. Nothing really important, is mainly there for hoarding.

### evolutionary-rescue-basic-discrete-time.Rmd
Base Code provided by Claudia Bank. Simulates a simple evolutionary rescue.
